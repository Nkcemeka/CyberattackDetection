# power_system_classification
Nothing much....this short basic project simply reads training data off 15 csv files and uses the information there to be able to detect events in an industrial power system. With the help of the training data, the built ML models would be able to classify if these events are "ATTACKS" or not. This project also highlights the importance of exploratory data analysis before attempting to build any ML model.
