# Detection of CyberAttacks in an Industrial Power System
This short project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning in detecting cyberattacks. In essence, I aim to read training data off 15 csv files and use the information there to detect events in an industrial power system. With the help of the training data, the built ML models would be able to classify if these events are "ATTACKS" or not. 

## Notes
- This project does not aim to just build ML models but to also highlight the importance of exploratory data analysis
- The developed models were not saved and deployed in an industrial setting
